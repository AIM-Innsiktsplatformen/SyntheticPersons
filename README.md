# README.md

## Introduction

Welcome to this repository! In here, you will find a Jupyter Notebook that contains code to interact with the OpenAI API. The notebook makes it easy to run and experiment with the code, while also providing explanations and insights throughout the process.

## Getting Started

To start using the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or `conda install --file requirements.txt` if you're using Anaconda) in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook by running `jupyter notebook` in your terminal or command prompt.

## Adding Your OpenAI API Key

Before you can run the code in the notebook, you will need to add your OpenAI API key. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Locate the `source` folder in the repository.
2. Find the `api_key.py` file within the `source` folder.
3. Open the `api_key.py` file in your preferred text editor.
4. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key, which should be a string. Make sure to keep the quotes around the key.
5. Save the file and close the text editor.

Now you're all set to run the notebook and start interacting with the OpenAI API!
